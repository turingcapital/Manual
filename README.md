# Overview
*“Those who can imagine anything, can create the impossible.” ― Alan Turing*

Turing is a cryptofund. We make investments in blockchain companies, protocols, and tokens.

### How We Help
Turing is for founders, by founders.

We’re hackers, deep thinkers, and rule breakers.

We look for teams with an ambitious vision. We like to invest at the earliest stages and roll up our sleeves. We help our teams on strategy, token sales, fundraising, marketing, recruiting, design, company building, and coaching.

## DAO
Turing is structured as a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO). Anyone can join and contribute to our network. 

We're currently looking for content editors, scouts, analysts, and technical advisors. Contact us if interested.
